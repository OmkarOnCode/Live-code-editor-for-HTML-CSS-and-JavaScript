whenever the user writes his code and stores into the database and clicking on the save button
the php code checks for the condition ehether the user has written the code or not
if the user has not written any codes then the new row is created for the user when the user saves the codes
and when any modifications are done in the written code after the next login
then it will update the code when clicked on the save button 
and whenever the user loginins again the code written by the user are fetched from the database
and showed to the user in the textarea.
